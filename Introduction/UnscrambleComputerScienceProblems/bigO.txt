Reading data from CSV files is worst-case O(n), as you are iterating over each record in the file exactly once and
storing it into memory. The analysis for the following tasks will not take reading data from CSVs into account.

Task 0: O(1)
Printing records doesn't involve any iterative process. It is a constant time operation, therefore O(1).

Task 1: O(n)
Overall worst-case time complexity for iterating over 'calls' and 'texts' exactly once for each has an overall time
complexity of O(n), as time increases linearly with the number of input records.

Task 2: O(n)
Worst-case time complexity for the unique_directory function is O(n), as is max_dur. These are both linear to the number
 of records in the datasets.

Task 3: O(n log n)
Due to the sorting in the bngl_outgoing function, the overall time complexity for this program is O(n log n). Without
sorting, the program would return O(n), as pct_fixed_bngl and print_a are both O(n).

Task 4: O(n log n)
Due to the sorting in the potential_telemarketers, the overall time complexity for this program is O(n log n). Without
sorting, worst-case time complexity would be O(n), as each iterate over each record a single time without nested operations.
